We provide a new 3D hyperspectral data capturing feature deep into the soil, where each voxel represents a spectrum vector. For effective analysis of this type of new hyperspectral data, we develop a 3D visualization tool to not only directly visualize the individual spectrum of the soil volume but also provide a way to cluster such high-dimensional data, leveraging a deep learning-based method through autoencoder.
